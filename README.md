# YT2Plex
Pull YouTube live streams into m3u playlist and xml guide for use with IPTV.  Configured for use with xteve on an unraid system, but this can be changed by editing the directories in main.py

# SETUP

Can be found in community applications

  ENABLE FFMPEG

  Xteve -> Settings -> Streaming -> Stream Buffer: FFmpeg

3. Add scripts folder from YT2Plex to xsteve

  On unraid the directory where to add /scripts should look something like:
    /mnt/user/appdata/xteve

4. Edit main.py
  Add your API key to API_KEY

   Sign up for youtube data api at https://console.developers.google.com/apis

   API key can be generated under credentials tab

    Requirements:
     
     Youtube channel ID (obtain from https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/youtube-channel-id-and-user-id-convertor/)
     
     Channel Name (Name you want to appear in channel guide)
     
     Channel Icon (Link to image you want to appear in channel guide)

  For Unraid systems:
    
    Install Nerd Tools from the community apps
    
    Open Nerd Tools
    
    Search for python
    
    Enable

7. Create a virtual enviroment for dependancies (Reccommended)

  In terminal:
     
     cd /path/to/your/directory

     pip3 install virtualenv

     virtualenv [Name of virtual env]

     source myenv/bin/activate

9. Install dependancies

   pip install google-api-python-client yt-dlp

11. Test

  Open Terminal
     
     /path/to/virtualenviroment/bin/python3 /path/to/xteve/scripts/main.py

   Verify playlist.m3u and guide.xml were created

11. Direct xteve to the new playlist and guide

  By default the xteve refers to its path as /root/.xteve so the path put into xteve should look like "/root/.xteve/scripts/playlist.m3u"

13. Map playlist and xmltv guide

14. Setup cronjob to run main.py however often you want to check the channels for live streams

    You may also want to set a job to refresh the guide in plex as the lowest refresh interval plex offers is 1hr

      Example command to refresh Plex guide:

      curl "http://127.0.0.1:32400/livetv/dvrs/4/reloadGuide?X-Plex-Token=<insert-plex-token-here>" -X "POST"

16. Add xteve to Plex in Live TV / DVR settings and scan
